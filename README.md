# Qriptos

This repo created for keeping track of learning Quantum Technologies.

This is where I started to learn -> -> -> [LinQer](https://qturkey.org/).

First training files can be reached [here](https://github.com/kasimerbay/Qriptos/blob/main/bronze_istanbul-master.zip). This training consists of Basics of Linear Algebra, Qubits and Quantum Computing.

My research notes on this topic [here](https://kasimerbay.github.io/Kuantum__Programlama.pdf) written in Turkish to be presented in a local firm that working on [criptology](https://www.ctech.com.tr/en/products/cyber-security/encryption-and-data-security-devices/kryptos)

A little bit of implementation of Quantum Computing, Quantum Random Number Generator, [here](https://github.com/kasimerbay/Qriptos/blob/main/Quantum_RNG.py).
